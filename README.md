Module 1 Activities
# Day 1
Level-1 :
~~~
1. Write a function to find biggest of 2 numbers using 
    - if else
    - ternary operator

 

2. Write a program to print the grade of the given student using if else if block
    - 90 to 100 -> "Grade A"
    - 75 to 89 -> "Grade B"
    - 60 to 74 -> "Grade C"
    - 50 to 59 -> "Grade D"
    - 0 to 49 -> "Grade F"

 

3. Write a program to read the 
    - Roll No
    - Name (Note, you should read full name of the student including initials)
    - Marks of Physics, Math and Chemistry
    Calculate the total, percentage and print the summary.

 

4. Write a simple calculator program which should accept inputs in the same order.
    - Operand 1
    - Operator
    - Operand 2
The order of scan should be same, for example, you should first scan in the following order.
printf("Enter Number1: );
Scan the first number form the user.
printf("Enter the operator: );
Scan the operator from the user.
printf("Enter Number2: );
Scan the second number form the user.

 

5. Write a function to accept an integer (32 bits) and operation type to do the following and return the result to main function.
    - Set 1st bit, if operation type is 1
    - Clear 31st bit, if operation type is 2
    - Toggle 16th bit, if operation type is 3
   You can consider the below function prototype,
    - bit_operations(int num, int oper_type);

1. Write a function to return the greatest of 3 number using if else if.

 

2. Write a function to return the grade of the given student using switch case statements
90 to 100 -> 'A'
75 to 89 -> 'B'
60 to 74 -> 'C'
50 to 59 -> 'D'
36 to 49 -> 'E'
0 to 35 -> 'F'

In main check the return value and print the below
65 -> "Grade A"
66 -> "Grade B"
67 -> "Grade C"
68 -> "Grade D"
69 -> "Grade E"
70 -> "Grade F"

 

3. Write a function to find if a give character is vowel using switch case statements, 
    - If vowel, return 1
    - If not vowel, return 0;

In main print,
"Vowel" if return value is 1
"Not Vowel" if return value is 1

 

4. Write a function to find the type of the character passed
    - 'A' to 'Z', return 1
    - 'a; to 'z', return 2
    - '0' to '9', return 3
    - Any Other printable symbols, return 4
    - Non printable symbols, return 5

# Day 2

Level-1:
~~~
1. Write a program to print exponent part of double variable in hexadecimal and binary format.
lets say we have x = 0.7, the exponent in hex is 0x3FE and 0b01111111110

Topics to be covered
- Pointers
- Bitwise Operators


2. Write a program to swap any type of data passed to an function.

Topics to be covered
- Pointers
- Type Casting

 

3. Write a program to sum every alternate elements of a given array starting for element 0
For example, let's say we have a[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}, the result should be 10 + 30 + 50 = 90

Topics to be covered
- Arrays
- Loops
- Basic Operators

 

4. Write a program to find total number of bits set in a given array.
Say we have a array of 3 elements
a[3] = {0x1, 0xF4, 0x10001};
The total number of set bits in the given array is
1 bit in 0x01, 5 in 0xF4, 2 in 0x10001, so the total is 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 bits

1. Write a program to swap every alternate element of a given array starting for element 0
For example, let's say we have a[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}, the result should be a[5] = {30, 20, 10, 40, 50}
one more example a[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60}, the result should be a[5] = {30, 20, 10, 60, 50, 40}

Topics to be covered
- Arrays

- Basic Operators

 

2. W.A.P to compare the items in a box, assume equal size boxes
Boxes shall have unique items stored in random order
Boxes are compared True if there is one to one mapping of items
return the final result 1 or 0

Example of Equal Boxes:
A[3] = {200, 10, -90}
B[3] = {-90, 200, 10}    

Example of Unequal Boxes:
A[3] = {200, 9, -90}
B[3] = {-90, 200, 10}    

Note: The array should not be sorted

3. Suppose 7 names are stored in an array of pointers names[] as shown below:
 char *name[]={
        "Santosh", "Amol", "Santosh Jain", "Kishore", "Rahul", "Amolkumar", "Hemant"
          }
  Write a program to arrange these names in alphabetical order.

 

4. Write a function xstrchr() which scans a string from beginning to end in search of a character. 
If the character is found, it should return a pointer to the first occurrence of the given character in the string.
If the given character is not found, the function returns a NULL.
The prototype of the function should be:

char *xstrchr(char *string, char ch):


5. Write a program to encode any given string such that it gets converted into an unrecognizable form. 
Also write a decode function to get back the original string.
